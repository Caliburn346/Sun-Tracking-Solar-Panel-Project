--------------Sun Tracking Solar Panel--------------

This project uses the Arduino Mega 2560 board to collect data from the LDRs and voltage divider circuit of the solar panels and actuate the two servo motors to track and follow the brightest
light source. The system is dual axis due to the application of the two servo motors. The library that this project uses is the "Servo.h" library.
